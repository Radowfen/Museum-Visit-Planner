There are 8 paintings in a museum

Their distances to visitor:

paintA = 30m
paintB = 60m
paintC = 5m
paintD = 15m
paintE = 40m
paintF = 100m
paintG = 80m
paintH = 25m





On console, user will select which paintings to visit. Using linked list and binary search tree algorithms, create a Java code that outputs the user to which paintings to visit in order for shortening the walk distance.
